# Chatlas.Query

## Chatlas.Query.Surface

- `Chatlas.Query.Surface` is the Chatlas session discovery interface family.
- `agentos chatlas index query` is the base query surface over Chatlas session index rows.
- `agentos chatlas query` is the higher-level session query surface.
- `agentos chatlas query` extends index selection with later query layers such as raw-artifact filtering, standard-model filtering, and row projection.
- The two commands may return different row shapes, but they should expose a consistent top-level query envelope.

## Chatlas.Query.Envelope

- `Chatlas.Query.Envelope` is the normalized top-level JSON response shape shared by Chatlas query surfaces.
- The envelope should keep query accounting separate from row projection.
- Shared count fields should use explicit phase names:
  - `index_matched_row_count`
  - `candidate_row_count`
  - `query_matched_row_count`
  - `returned_row_count`
- For `agentos chatlas index query`, the phases collapse because the only query layer is index selection.
- For `agentos chatlas query`, the phases remain layered:
  - index filters select index matches
  - scan limits choose candidates for expensive filters
  - raw and standard-model filters decide final query matches
  - final limit determines returned rows
- Row projection is intentionally independent from the envelope:
  - `agentos chatlas index query` returns full index rows
  - `agentos chatlas query` returns normalized session rows by default
